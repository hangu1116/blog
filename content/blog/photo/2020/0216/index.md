COVID-19 爆发后的第 27 天，整个上海都变得冷冷清清。工作后的第一个春节，没有了寒假，拖着一箱瓜果蔬菜飞回了上海。在家隔离的日子里，网上买菜自己做饭，只有取盒马生鲜时会下楼。街上空无一人，偶有麻雀从天空划过停在电缆线上。  
On the 27th day after the outbreak of covid-19, the whole of Shanghai became desolate. The first Spring Festival after work, there was no winter vacation, dragging a box of fruits and vegetables back to Shanghai. In the days of isolation at home, I buy vegetables online and cook by myself. Only when I get a box of fresh horses, I will go downstairs. There was no one over the street, and occasionally sparrows crossed the sky and stopped on the cable line.
